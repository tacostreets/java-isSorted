# java-isSorted
Java isSorted() method for IT212 Data Structures
1. Starting with the LinkedIntList example code, which will be reviewed in class, add a method isSorted() that returns true if the list is in sorted (nondecreasing) order and returns false otherwise.

An empty list is considered to be sorted.   75 points

2. Test your method from the ListTest class 25 points

Example  Console output:

[20, 11, 73, 111]
[20, 73, 111]
List sorted? true

[20, 73, 111, 7]
[20, 111, 7]
List sorted? false

SUBMIT 3 files:

1. Modified LinkedIntList  

2. Modified LinkTest

3. A screenshot of your test

Note: There is no need to submit ListNode, because you will not be modifying it. However, you will need to use this file in order to compile the rest of the code.
